* `network_functions`: the primary network analysis code, which later feeds into our final scoring process
* `networks`: a notebook illustrating the network analysis process for a single movie
* `network_train`: quick calculations to be used in normalizing the network scores in the final scoring process
* `network_exploration`: exploration of the information resulting from running `network_functions` on every movie
